```Cab Journey```

**The Cab Journey Project is a Java application that helps users find the shortest
routes between different locations within a city. It uses Dijkstra's Algorithm for 
finding individual shortest paths and the Floyd-Warshall Algorithm for determining 
shortest paths between all pairs of locations.**
